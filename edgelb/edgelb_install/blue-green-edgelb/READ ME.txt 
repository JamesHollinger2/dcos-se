This demo uses the following documentation link for the EdgeLb 1.0.1 bluegreen tutorial here:
https://docs.mesosphere.com/services/edge-lb/1.0/tutorials/blue-green-deploy/

It leverages 2 scripts
1. edgelb-1.0.1-blue.sh for the first half of the steps below
2. edgelb-1.0.1-bluetogreen for the second half and final step of switching to loadbalancing the "green service"

Please make sure to install your DCOS Cluster CLI before beginning...

Step1 of the script installs the repos for EdgeLB 1.0.1 [previous version was 1.0.0-rc5]
Step2 Installs EdgeLB and the CLI
Step3 Configures the EdgeLB pool using the sample-minimal.json file which initially load balances service svc-blue
Step4 Deployes the svc-blue json marathon app and exposes 'hello world on the public agent'
Step5 Leverages the second 'bluetogreen' script to update the EdgeLB pool configuration to use svc-green with sample-minimal2.json
  ** Note the correct command is either 'create' or 'update' (config no longer works)
Step6 Shows the final service (svc-green) exposed on the public agent

Tips:
Go to the Edgepool service and show 'ALL tasks'. You should see a sidecar pool container which was used to update the config with no downtime
Go to the logs of the Edgepool and API server to walk them through what just happened
Explain the larger value of immediate re-direction of loadbalanced traffic to the upgraded version green
